# Area-Under-Curve-Calculator

- The purpose of this program is to calculate a set of outputs given a set of inputs
- user can modify the "updatedValues" variable to change the function to their specification.
- program asks the user the amount of inputs and what each input is

*FUTURE UPDATES* 
- the program will be updated to calculate area under the curve using intergration 
- should be able to calculate using left endpoints, right endpoints, and midpoints 
- will ask for n number of rectangles and give an output 
- should be able to graph the function
