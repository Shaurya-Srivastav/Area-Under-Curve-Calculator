# Mathematical Function Analyzer

The **Mathematical Function Analyzer** is an advanced C++ application designed to empower users in the exploration and analysis of mathematical functions. This versatile tool not only calculates the area under curves and performs numerical integration but also offers advanced features like parsing and graphing complex mathematical expressions.

## Features

- **Precise Area Calculations:** Calculate the area under a curve with exceptional precision using both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint methods.
- **Numerical Integration:** Perform numerical integration within a specified interval using the efficient trapezoidal rule.
- **Expression Parsing:** Input complex mathematical expressions, and the program will intelligently parse and evaluate them.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Utilizes the `matplotlib-cpp` library for plotting mathematical functions, providing visual insights into the functions.
- **Flexible Input Handling:** Capable of handling a wide range of user-defined functions, including trigonometric, exponential, polynomial, and piecewise-defined functions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- [matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp): A C++ library for plotting that requires Python and Matplotlib.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/math-function-analyzer.git
   cd math-function-analyzer
   ```

2. **Compile the Program:**

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o math_function_analyzer
   ```

3. **Install matplotlib-cpp:**

   Ensure that you have installed the `matplotlib-cpp` library for graph plotting. Follow the installation instructions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp).

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   ./math_function_analyzer
   ```

2. **Interactive Console:**

   The program guides you through various steps:
   - Enter the number of data points and provide their values.
   - Specify the width of rectangles for area calculations.
   - Input the integration interval [a, b] and the number of intervals for integration.
   - Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., 'x^2 + sin(x)') for analysis.

3. **In-Depth Analysis:**

   The program performs a thorough analysis and provides detailed results:
   - Calculated areas using both methods.
   - The integral of the function within the specified interval.
   - A graphical plot of the function using `matplotlib-cpp` for visual interpretation.

## Advanced Configuration

- **Customization:** Modify the source code to accommodate specific requirements, such as increasing the maximum number of data points (`kMaxDataPoints`).
- **Enhanced Parsing:** Extend error handling and security mechanisms for mathematical expression parsing to meet your application's needs.

## Technical Details

### Code Structure

- **main.cpp:** The central program file responsible for user interactions, area calculations, numerical integration, and graphical plotting.
- **matplotlibcpp.h:** The header file facilitating interaction with the `matplotlib-cpp` library.

### Mathematical Expression Parsing

- **Expression Parsing:** The program employs a robust mathematical expression parser to transform user-defined functions into lambda functions.
- **Lambda Functions:** These functions are dynamically generated and utilized for numerical integration and graph plotting.

### Numerical Integration

- **Trapezoidal Rule:** Numerical integration is executed using the trapezoidal rule, providing reliable results.
- **Subintervals:** The program discretizes the specified interval into smaller subintervals, employing the trapezoid rule for each.

### Graphical Plotting

- **Matplotlib Integration:** The program seamlessly integrates with `matplotlib-cpp` for creating visually informative graphs.
- **Graph Quality:** Output graphs are of high quality and can be customized further using Matplotlib's rich feature set.
